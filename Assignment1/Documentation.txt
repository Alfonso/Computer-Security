Running the Code:
    Since I use python 3, on the ilab you will need to utilize python3 as python links to
    python 2.
    An example on how to call the AddUser function is seen below:

    "python3 portal.py "AddUser" "Alfonso" "password"

    This should invoke the AddUser command and create some JSON files that stores the information
    that has been added using these files.
